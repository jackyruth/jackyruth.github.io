# My Personal Website

## Purpose
This is a multi-purpose website
1. A medium, to showcase my skills, experiences and education
2. A portfolio, to house my personal engineering projects
3. A blog, to share preserve and timestamp, my thoughts
4. A channel, for others to contact me

# Design 
The nav bar will contain the following sections which corresponds one-to-one with the purpose of my website. To maintain simple usage, there will be *no drop down bars* 
1. About: 
	* A quick description of me
	* Link to my resume and my LinkedIn
2. Projects: 
	* A grid like display of all my projects
	* Clicking on a particular project opens a new html file in a new tab
	* Include a *back* button to return to the main **project** page
	* Future: Add a side bar which can filter the projects displayed by *type of project* (ex. Physics, Programming, Hardware)
3. Posts: 
	* A scrolling list of blog posts
	* Clicking on a particular blog post opens a new html file in a new tab
	* Include a *back* button to return to the main **posts** page
	* Future: Add a side bar which can filter the posts by topic
4. Contact
	* An embedded form with *Topic*, *Email Address* and *Message* fields
