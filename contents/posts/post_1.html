            only 600 or so shots in this 2.5 hr long movie, which allowed one to admire the
            extreme detail and the slow, careful deployment of technology. I think the
            amount of time the movie allows the scene to settle allowed me to treat the

            much of anything at all. Frank Poole slowly eat his food as he watches the
            interview he conducted. David Bowman sketches, do some tame exercises and plays
            chess with HAL 9000. Granted that they were on a long isolated journey to
            Jupiter, but the slowness of their action lends a sense of peace, similar to
            the feeling of the dull hours on a international flight. I am quite attracted
            to the idea of focused, slow relaxation, particularly since these astronauts
            proved that they are highly intelligent men, seemingly without ego, and ready
            to be deadly-focused and get down to work at the moments notice.</span></p>

            and Quail's Gate. There was so much to do all the time, and in the beginning, I
            had a tendency to move as fast I possible. It is only 3 months later, after I
            had gone through some of the consequences of my moving-as-fast as I possibly

            tinkering with hardware, exploring with programming and mathematics or
            performing actions involved in solving a problem or resolving a situation, keep
            a clear description of the action taken. Observe closely, the resulting affect
            of that action and hold both the action and the observation present in your
            mind as you inch forward towards the solution. Do not let timelines and the
            long list of to-do tasks perturb your mind from engaging in this cognitively

            could have skipped the &quot;recreate and record bug&quot; stage and moved on
            directly to the debugging stage. This would have definitely saved me a lot of

            "Calibri",sans-serif'>In realizing this, two things clicked in my mind. This
            better way of problem solving is manifested in Astronauts in 2001 and the
            officers in Star Trek TNG. When one watches these films, one can clearly see
            that the scenes emphasizes that the characters employ a cause-and-effect
            approach to problem solving. In every situation, even life and death, the
            character of David Bowman always takes the time to carefully consider his
            actions, and when he has made his decision, do them. Upon completing his
            action, he always pauses and observes the changes that results, before
            considering his next action again. I shall name this problem-solving mindset
            the David Bowman technique. </span></p>
            
            <p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

            <p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
            "Calibri",sans-serif'>The difficulty in adhering to the David Bowman technique
            is that whenever a task is successfully completed, one gets the feeling that it
            would have been completely successfully even without the rigorous attention to
            detail. Eventually, perhaps due to the success of the David Bowman technique,
            one feels as if things can be done much faster if more careless heuristics were
            to be used. The success of the David Bowman technique would also be the cause
            of its downfall from grace. On the other hand, if the task is completed
            successfully with someone employing the wishy washy,
            do-everything-as-fast-as-possible approach, one gets a sense of achievement and
            pride that comes with completing a task so quickly. And purely due to the
            nature of projects, many more tasks are completely successfully than are not,
            the feedback is not on the David Bowman technique's side, even if the few
            unsuccessful tasks turn out to be the biggest expenditure of time. </span></p>

            "Calibri",sans-serif'>The David Bowman technique becomes more powerful when
            accompanied by another problem-solving (project-making) principle I call the
            principle of least action. This principle says to only do what is absolutely
            necessary to achieve one's goal. This principle is the greatest time saver of
            all. Ask yourself, is this task that I am about to embark on absolutely
            necessary for the success of the project ( or the solution of the problem ). If
            not, then find something that is and focus on that. </span></p>

            "Calibri",sans-serif'>Here is an example. About 3 weeks before the deployment
            of the hardware devices, I started to consider how I can characterize those
            devices. I told myself that by knowing more about the devices, then if there
            was an issue with a device, I can debug it and fix it much faster. But 3 weeks
            before deployment is exactly the time where a lot of devices need to be
            assembled and verified. I asked myself, what does the affect of characterizing
            the devices have on the assembly and deployment of those devices. The answer is
            none. There would be no actionable result from characterizing the devices
            because the design of the device is already set in stone. So I freed up a lot
            of time for the important assembly work by pushing the task of characterizing
            the devices until after the deployment of the devices. This adheres to the
            principle of least action.</span></p>

            "Calibri",sans-serif'>In both cases of the principle of least action and the
            David Bowman technique, it is useful to constantly question every action one
            makes. Again, this extends the time needed to complete tasks, but it allows for
            better application of the principle of least action and the David Bowman
            technique, which will save you time and money. Their benefits will scale with
            the complexity of the project and compound with the duration. </span></p>
