only 600 or so shots in this 2.5 hr long movie, which allowed one to admire the
extreme detail and the slow, careful deployment of technology. I think the
amount of time the movie allows the scene to settle allowed me to treat the
astronauts as real people and observe how they conduct themselves in their long

much of anything at all. Frank Poole slowly eat his food as he watches the
interview he conducted. David Bowman sketches, do some tame exercises and plays
chess with HAL 9000. Granted that they were on a long isolated journey to
Jupiter, but the slowness of their action lends a sense of peace, similar to
the feeling of the dull hours on a international flight. I am quite attracted
to the idea of focused, slow relaxation, particularly since these astronauts
proved that they are highly intelligent men, seemingly without ego, and ready
to be deadly-focused and get down to work at the moments notice.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>I have been working on Verdi, the agricultural technology
startup of which I am the hardware co-founder. I laden myself with the massive
workload of designing the hardware for Verdi's two pilot projects at Arterra
and Quail's Gate. There was so much to do all the time, and in the beginning, I
had a tendency to move as fast I possible. It is only 3 months later, after I
had gone through some of the consequences of my moving-as-fast as I possibly
could, that I realized there laid a better path from January to April, than the
one I had taken.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>In matters of engineering, and I think problem solving in
general, always work with intent, focus and diligence. Whether you are
tinkering with hardware, exploring with programming and mathematics or
performing actions involved in solving a problem or resolving a situation, keep
a clear description of the action taken. Observe closely, the resulting affect
of that action and hold both the action and the observation present in your
mind as you inch forward towards the solution. Do not let timelines and the
long list of to-do tasks perturb your mind from engaging in this cognitively
demanding fashion of problem solving. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>I realized that had I &quot;moved less fast&quot; and
been more engaged in mentally recording my actions and its effect on the
hardware, I wouldn't have wasted so much time and resources recreating bugs. I
could have skipped the &quot;recreate and record bug&quot; stage and moved on
directly to the debugging stage. This would have definitely saved me a lot of
time and money in the last three months.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>In realizing this, two things clicked in my mind. This
better way of problem solving is manifested in Astronauts in 2001 and the
officers in Star Trek TNG. When one watches these films, one can clearly see
that the scenes emphasizes that the characters employ a cause-and-effect
approach to problem solving. In every situation, even life and death, the
character of David Bowman always takes the time to carefully consider his
actions, and when he has made his decision, do them. Upon completing his
action, he always pauses and observes the changes that results, before
considering his next action again. I shall name this problem-solving mindset
the David Bowman technique. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>The difficulty in adhering to the David Bowman technique
is that whenever a task is successfully completed, one gets the feeling that it
would have been completely successfully even without the rigorous attention to
detail. Eventually, perhaps due to the success of the David Bowman technique,
one feels as if things can be done much faster if more careless heuristics were
to be used. The success of the David Bowman technique would also be the cause
of its downfall from grace. On the other hand, if the task is completed
successfully with someone employing the wishy washy,
do-everything-as-fast-as-possible approach, one gets a sense of achievement and
pride that comes with completing a task so quickly. And purely due to the
nature of projects, many more tasks are completely successfully than are not,
the feedback is not on the David Bowman technique's side, even if the few
unsuccessful tasks turn out to be the biggest expenditure of time. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>But having gone through the last three months, I know
better. I will train to employ the David Bowman technique.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>The David Bowman technique becomes more powerful when
accompanied by another problem-solving (project-making) principle I call the
principle of least action. This principle says to only do what is absolutely
necessary to achieve one's goal. This principle is the greatest time saver of
all. Ask yourself, is this task that I am about to embark on absolutely
necessary for the success of the project ( or the solution of the problem ). If
not, then find something that is and focus on that. </span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>Here is an example. About 3 weeks before the deployment
of the hardware devices, I started to consider how I can characterize those
devices. I told myself that by knowing more about the devices, then if there
was an issue with a device, I can debug it and fix it much faster. But 3 weeks
before deployment is exactly the time where a lot of devices need to be
assembled and verified. I asked myself, what does the affect of characterizing
the devices have on the assembly and deployment of those devices. The answer is
none. There would be no actionable result from characterizing the devices
because the design of the device is already set in stone. So I freed up a lot
of time for the important assembly work by pushing the task of characterizing
the devices until after the deployment of the devices. This adheres to the
principle of least action.</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style='margin:0cm'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:
"Calibri",sans-serif'>In both cases of the principle of least action and the
David Bowman technique, it is useful to constantly question every action one
makes. Again, this extends the time needed to complete tasks, but it allows for
better application of the principle of least action and the David Bowman
technique, which will save you time and money. Their benefits will scale with
the complexity of the project and compound with the duration. </span></p>
