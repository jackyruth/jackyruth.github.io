# Flow of Content
In a way, this website is simply a public modport (in the SystemVerilog sense) of my more extensive and private journal system. 
Although my journal system has a set structure, the medium on which it is hosted may change. Currently, it is on OneNote.

## Way one: Onenote -> Word -> html
This is probably the best way.

## Way two: Latex -> html via htlatex 
If I wish to publish my latex docs, I need to figure out how I can incorporate the resulting html file into the existing html template.
I do not see a easy way to do this, so I will probably stick to using Word to translate into html
