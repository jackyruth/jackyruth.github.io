# Contact

I want to have a form where people can send me a message and put down their contact information. Unfortunately, github pages does host server scripts so the default *contact me* from the template does not work.

I have tried to embed google forms but that does not work either.
Honestly, adding an embedded form is too much hassle. Most people who come to my website are there to see what I can do and they want my contact information anyways. 

So instead of a form, I have decided to put my contact information instead.
